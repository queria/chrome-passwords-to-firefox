# Tool for converting passwords from Google Chrome to Firefox.
#
# Reads from chrome's plain sqlite "Login Data" file
# and generates xml files suitable for use with FFX `Password Exporter addon`_.
#
# (addon is atm NOT compatible with current firefox 57+,
#  so get older one (e.g. from `Mozilla FTP`_, e.g. 56, install addon,
#  import passwords, and then run again your new/current firefox
#  [nightly||aurora in my case])
#
# Copy your "Login Data" ($HOME/.config/google-chrome/Default/Login\ Data)
# next to this file, and run this.
# It will generate two xml files passlist.xml and blacklist.xml,
# to be used for importing via Password Exporter addon for Firefox.
#
# If this script fails with exception, likely You will have to tweak the code,
# as there may be unexpected cases (like url schemes/protocols not used by me
# etc, and atm i'm not trying to figure out those).
#
# If Password Exporter reports issues (most likely collisions etc),
# you may want to remove all passwords from firefox,
# tweak passlist.xml by hand and re-import again.
# (E.g. i had multiple passwords with same account stored in chrome,
#  while some/most of them actually outdated so clear those, keep just valid
#  ones)
#
# This worked for me to great deal (>300 passwords copied and working, bunch of
# blacklisted ones etc) with having to tweak ~10 in xml by hand,
# but no promise it will work for you.
